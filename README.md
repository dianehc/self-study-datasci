self-study-datasci
==================
This repository will be a compilation of cited assignments, modules, and activities collected and
completed from the wide variety of free resources, courses, and tutorials that I come across on the web. 
The two primary languages that I initially intend to work with are Python and R. 

I intend to include a link to all activities that I work on and would appreciate a heads-up if I miss citing anything - 
Or, if you might happen to notice any specific errors or style/form considerations that I've overlooked. 

Best wishes for a lovely season, 
Diane
